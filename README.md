# Spring_BOOT.java



The JavaFX CRUD Application with Spring Boot Backend is a project that showcases the integration of JavaFX for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend services. The application focuses on demonstrating simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and incorporates a login functionality along with a user dashboard view, which allows users to switch between different scenes.

Main Working:
The project consists of two main components: the frontend implemented using JavaFX and the backend services implemented using Spring Boot.

The frontend of the application is developed using JavaFX, a modern GUI framework for Java. It provides a rich set of UI controls and allows developers to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces. The JavaFX frontend includes two main scenes: the Login view and the User Dashboard view.

The Login view presents users with a login form where they can enter their credentials. Upon successful authentication, the application grants access to the User Dashboard view.

The User Dashboard view serves as the main interface for users. It provides functionality for performing CRUD operations on certain entities, such as creating new records, reading existing records, updating records, and deleting records. Users can navigate between different views or scenes within the User Dashboard, enabling them to manage their data efficiently.

The backend services of the application are implemented using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for building robust and scalable web applications. Spring Boot simplifies the development process by providing a comprehensive set of tools and features for creating RESTful APIs, handling data persistence, and managing application logic. It enables seamless communication between the frontend and the backend, ensuring smooth data flow and efficient processing of CRUD operations.

Technologies Used:

JavaFX: The frontend of the application is built using JavaFX, a powerful GUI framework for Java that offers a wide range of UI controls and allows developers to create visually appealing user interfaces.

Spring Boot: The backend services are implemented using Spring Boot, a Java framework that simplifies the development of web applications by providing features for handling RESTful APIs, data persistence, and application logic.

The JavaFX CRUD Application with Spring Boot Backend combines the strengths of JavaFX and Spring Boot to create an interactive application that showcases CRUD operations. The use of JavaFX ensures a user-friendly and visually appealing frontend, while Spring Boot provides a robust and efficient backend infrastructure. This project serves as a demonstration of how these technologies can be integrated to develop powerful and scalable applications.
